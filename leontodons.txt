Leontodon, commonly known as hawkbits, is a genus of flowering plants in the family Asteraceae. These plants are often found in meadows, grasslands, and along roadsides across Europe, Asia, and North Africa. Leontodons are typically characterized by their bright yellow flowers, which resemble those of dandelions, to which they are closely related. The plants are usually low-growing perennials or biennials with a rosette of basal leaves and long, slender stems that bear a single flower head. The name "Leontodon" comes from the Greek words "leon" (lion) and "odon" (tooth), referring to the toothed edges of the leaves.

Leontodons play an important role in their ecosystems by providing nectar and pollen for a variety of pollinators, including bees, butterflies, and other insects. These plants are particularly valuable in environments where other nectar sources may be scarce, helping to sustain pollinator populations throughout the growing season. Additionally, Leontodons are hardy and adaptable, thriving in a range of soil types and climatic conditions, making them a common and resilient feature of many landscapes.

Beyond their ecological significance, Leontodons have also been used in traditional medicine. Historically, various parts of the plant have been utilized for their purported health benefits, including as a diuretic and digestive aid. The leaves are sometimes used in salads or cooked as greens, similar to dandelion leaves, although they can have a slightly bitter taste. While not as widely recognized as some other wildflowers, Leontodons contribute to the biodiversity of their habitats and have a quiet yet enduring presence in the natural world.
